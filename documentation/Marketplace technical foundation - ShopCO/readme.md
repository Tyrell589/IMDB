## Project Overview

ShopCO is a modern, responsive e-commerce website and a comprehensive marketplace technical foundation for an innovative business idea. Developed as part of Hackathon 3, this project builds upon the UI/UX designs from Hackathon 2, transforming them into a fully functional platform.

The planning focuses on creating a dynamic business infrastructure, addressing data schemas for managing products, customers, orders, shipments, and payments. By leveraging Sanity CMS for content management and Next.js for frontend development, ShopCO ensures a seamless flow of data between the backend and frontend systems.

The vision behind ShopCO is to offer a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly marketplace with robust features like real-time updates, intuitive navigation, and a premium shopping experience. The project not only lays the groundwork for a thriving e-commerce business but also highlights a commitment to cutting-edge technology and user-centric design. ðŸš€

## Sanity and Next JS Interaction
Sanity CMS is integrated into the Next.js application to provide dynamic and flexible content management. The interaction works as follows:

![Sanity and NextJS Intraction](/documentation/images/sanity-nextjs-intraction.png)

1. **Data Management in Sanity:** All the e-commerce data (e.g., products, orders, customers) is stored and managed in Sanity's content studio.

2. **Fetching Data:** Next.js fetches data from Sanity using GROQ queries via Sanity's API endpoints. These queries retrieve structured content, ensuring high flexibility.

3. **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** For dynamic pages like product detail pages, order details page.

4. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pages like home and category pages are pre-rendered at build time. 

5. **Real-time Updates:** Sanity's webhooks notify the application of changes, enabling immediate updates without manual rebuilds.

6. **Rendering Components:** The fetched data is passed to React components for rendering dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

This seamless integration ensures a robust and scalable e-commerce platform.
